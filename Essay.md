# Assignment 2-2

### Problem
Create a program that converts celsius to fahrenheit

### Code Description 
Create two variables that hold an integer and the other a float.
The cellius variable takes in user input of degrees in celsius.
The fahreheit varibale then divides 9/5 and multiplies it by the celsius variable (integer value) and adds 32 to it.
We then print it to the console to give us our degrees in fahrenheit from celsius.

### Errors and Lessons
An error i encounted was how to properly use the %.2f function to round to two decimal points. I was adding the function after the variable. I Lesson i learned was how python reads math left to right.
